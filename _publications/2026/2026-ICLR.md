abstract: >-
  Fine-tuning is a standard approach for adapting large language models to downstream tasks, but its efficiency is limited by high memory consumption, largely dominated by activations. We propose TokenSeek, a universal plugin for transformer-based models that performs instance-aware token seeking and ditching, achieving substantial memory savings (e.g., only 14.8% on Llama3.2 1B) while maintaining or even improving performance. Moreover, its interpretable token-seeking mechanism provides insights into why token efficiency can be improved.
